# Koda VM
A simple Koda bytecode interpreter written in C++. 

Koda is a bytecode that I came up with myself.  
Some temporary specs can be found in [BytecodeSpecs.md](https://github.com/JanoschABR/koda-vm/blob/master/BytecodeSpecs.md)  
These specs are very likely to change in the future.

Some example code can be found in `bytecode.bin`.
