# Koda VM
A simple Koda bytecode interpreter written in C/C++.  
Koda is a bytecode that I came up with myself and it isn't properly defined yet.

Some example Koda code can be found in `bytecode.bin`.  
As mentioned before, this is completely undocumented and will most likely change a lot in the future.
